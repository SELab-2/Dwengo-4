There's only integration tests so far.
To run the integration tests, first make sure you're running the database locally as explained in the README.md file at the project root.
Then you can use the command `npm run test:int` to run all the tests in this folder.

You can learn more about how the test framework works at https://www.prisma.io/blog/testing-series-3-aBUyF8nxAn.
